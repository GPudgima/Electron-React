## React / Electron Production || Deployment ready Boiler-Plate.
Boiler-plate to make customisable apps on the go. ðŸ˜˜

I'm very new to all of this (4 months of learning css, html & js), so if there are any errors
that you find, please let me know - and i'll try my best to fix them.

## Instructions to get started.
Clone the repo & run 'npm install' in the clone directory.

That's it simple - if you're new to React you might need to read up on it (I know I have to still).

## package.json scripts.
To run the app in dev mode just run 'npm run electron-dev', it should run React on localhost:3000 &
have electron point to it.

## Deployment
Everything has been done in the background - all you'll need to do is update the name, author & file paths in
package.json and your react side of things.

Once ready to deploy run 'npm run electron-pack' and it'll start to deploy the app. 


## That's all there is to it(I think).
If you think i've missed something important please let me know, because I hardly know anything about Electron & or React.
